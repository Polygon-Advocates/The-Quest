# Contributing to the DAO Smart Contract (Hard Level)

Thank you for your interest in wanting to contribute to the hard level of the DAO smart contract! This level is intended for those who have experience with Ethereum smart contract development and are interested in building additional functionality for the contract.

The **main objective** is to create a functionality for the DAO where memebers who staked their tokens can only vote.

To get started, please follow the steps below:

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

To contribute to the DAO smart contract, you will need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes to the code and submit pull requests to merge your changes back into the main repository.

## Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment

To develop and test the smart contract, setup the contract in Remix IDE.

## Step 3: Build and deploy Your Changes

Once you have set up your development environment, deploy the contract to testnet or to the local environment.

## Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

After you have done your changes and are satisfied with them, you can submit a pull request to merge your changes back into the main repository. Please make sure to describe your changes in the pull request and provide any relevant documentation.
